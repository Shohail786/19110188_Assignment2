#### The assignment is on the Face Recognition using the Eigenfaces. It uses the dimensionality reduction and linear algebra concepts. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique which uses Eigenvalues and EigenVectors to reduce the dimensionality.


#### There are 450 images. These images are divided into train and test images. There are 405 train images and 45 test images. The dataset is taken from the Caltech Faces dataset.

#### These are the steps:

1) Grayscale, Resize and Crop the image
2) Caculate the mean
3) Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
4) Test the image on the different K values from 1 to 25 and plot the graph to represent the error percent and k(number of eigenvectors)
